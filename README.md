# Safety-Belt-Patent
Official patent for an intelligent safety belt system designed to detect motion and prevent injuries during high-altitude work.

This repository includes the documentation for one of my officially registered inventions:

Title: Electronic Safety Belt at High Altitudes to Prevent Injury and Shock

This invention is a type of smart safety strap designed for people working at height — such as construction workers, technicians, or rescuers. It uses built-in sensors to detect speed, movement, and direction, allowing it to identify when a person is losing balance or falling. Once a dangerous motion is detected, the system responds quickly to prevent or reduce injury through controlled restraint or shock absorption.

This technology can be used in high-risk environments to provide better protection and peace of mind during demanding tasks.
